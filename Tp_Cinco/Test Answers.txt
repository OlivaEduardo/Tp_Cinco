Functions tests answers are here.

(1) c) It is implemenmtation dependant. If left just as written in the example, a compilation error is issued because the type conversion for the parameter is ambiguous.
But if we specify the variable type to one of the parameters or take the signed specifier from the function declaration and definition, there won't be a compilation 
error and the new function will be called.

(2) d) There is a link error, none of the functions are included in the main file (No header file is included). If we include both files / functions, the one with the Int parameter will be called.

(3) d) There is a link error, the function has not default parameters declared in the header.

(4) c)

(5) b)

(6) d) There is a compilation error because the overload methods cannot have only different return types.

(7) a)
